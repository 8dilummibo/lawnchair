In this section, we will give you some tips and examples on how to improvise over the II-V7-I progression using Jamey Aebersold's PDF download. First, you need to understand the basic chord/scale relationships that apply to this progression. For each chord, there is a corresponding scale or mode that contains the same notes and fits the chord quality. For example, over a Dm7 chord, you can use the D Dorian mode, which is the same as the C major scale starting from the second degree. Over a G7 chord, you can use the G Mixolydian mode, which is the same as the C major scale starting from the fifth degree. And over a Cmaj7 chord, you can use the C Ionian mode, which is the same as the C major scale starting from the first degree.
 
These modes are also known as the diatonic scales, because they are derived from the major scale and follow a pattern of whole and half steps. They are the most common and basic scales to use over the II-V7-I progression, and they will give you a smooth and consonant sound. However, they are not the only scales you can use. You can also experiment with other scales and modes that create different colors and tensions over each chord. For example, over a G7 chord, you can use the G Lydian dominant mode, which is the same as the C melodic minor scale starting from the fifth degree. This mode has a raised fourth degree, which creates a sharp sound over the dominant chord. Or you can use the G altered scale, which is the same as the Ab melodic minor scale starting from the seventh degree. This scale has a lowered fifth, ninth, and thirteenth degree, which creates a very tense and dissonant sound over the dominant chord.
 
Jamey Aebersold's PDF download provides you with a scale syllabus that lists all the possible scales and modes you can use over each chord in the II-V7-I progression. It also shows you how to spell and play them on your instrument. You should study this syllabus carefully and memorize the scales and modes in all 12 keys. Then you should practice them over the play-along tracks that come with the PDF download. These tracks are recorded by professional jazz musicians and have different styles and tempos for you to choose from. You can play along with them and improvise using the scales and modes you have learned.
